# LocationLock

Inspired by the TV show Agents of Shield, I decided to recreate a bit of technology they used in the show, location based encryption.
In its current state, this program must be installed from the apk of the Android Studio Project to an android device. Meanwhile, the user should also run the lockdown.py program. This program allows the user to connect to a cell phone which would be running the app. Because most computers do not have their own GPS chips, the cell phone uses the User Datagram Protocol to get the users location. After receiving a password on both ends, the program encrypts/decrypts the requested file.
